MASS to Tag (index this field) (be sure to remove the null after creating)
REPLY_COUNT to Post (default to 0, index this field too) (besure to remove allow null after creating)
MASS to Post (remember to index and eventually disalow null)

V7_MIGRATION_AddCountsToPosts.sql

-- the following must be run in this order! Put the mass on the tags first. The second proc modifys title tags only.
-- if not run in the proper order the reply based mass for title tags will be over written
V7_MIGRATION_AddMassToTag.sql - As of 2/8/2010 this query was run again, after adding title association tags to all posts(V7_MIGRATION_AddTitleTagAssociationsToAllPosts.sql) this has to be done after that( you can do it twice, or try changing the order. If you dont do it then the tag cloud will not be accurate)
V7_MIGRATION_AddTitleReplyCountToTag.sql - As of 11/11/2009 this change is not going to be used

Adding title tags for ALL posts. It seems that the fancy searching and filtering from lucene will allow me to search for titles without touching the tags
which frees me up to make the title title tags work the way they were initially intended to (on all posts) so this proc puts them into place:
V7_MIGRATION_AddTitleTagAssociationsToAllPosts.sql


- FEB 11 (this change was all about adding the sortable tag titles to the title tags, also i put the title tag in the post)
created SORT_VALUE on Tag (varchar(255))
created TITLE_TAG_GUID on Post (uniqueid)
proc: V7_MIGRATION_AddThreadTitleTAGToPost.sql
Run migration.SortValueOnTag java program


- Feb 14
V7_MIGRATION_RemoveDuplicateAssociations.sql

--Feb 21
add Column to Entry  SUMMARY as text
Run java code to create summaries, same code injects trev tag styling in prep for rich text editing
EntrySummaryAndTagRemoveForV7.java

** Investigate what post.THREAD_REPLY_DATE was for?  Ok, i think that this is used for the real front page queries

For the love of all things holy make it so that style names can be more than 10 characters!
