//Here is an idea of what is needed to go straight from v6 to v7. 
//Remember to fix the CalculateAverageRating program and look at merging some of the sql scripts  

	Create columns (***For the love of all things holy make it so that style names can be more than 10 characters!)
	Post
	META_MASK	bigint (not null, default 0) [For june 10 load this was binary 8 and caused an exception when building post indexes]  
	TAG_GUID_TITLE	uniqueidentifier
	PERSON_GUID_CREATOR	uniqueidentifier
	TAG_GUID_AVG_RATING	uniqueidentifier
	URL	varchar(500)
	PUBLISH_YEAR	smallint
	THREAD_GUID uniqueidentifier
	LATEST_ENTRY_GUID unique
	EDIT_DATE datetime
	THREAD_REPLY_DATE datetime
	REPLY_COUNT int default 0 not null
	MASS int default 0 not null
	//make POST.PATH 255
	
	Style
	DEFAULT_STYLE 'bit' flag to Style table. Default to '0'
	
	Tag:
	SORT_VALUE on Tag (varchar(255)
	//Remove the TAG.CREATOR column 
	
	Entry:
	SUMMARY as text
	
	
	
	
	V7_RENORMALIZATION_MetaBitmask.sql - Took: Over an hour! (redone two seconds now)
	
		
	//*** if you want disable bridges in Post.java during this run? It's trying to build stuff and the bridges dont all work yet... 
	// the exception doesnt seem to stop the path's from being updated though.  
	//Open hibernate.cfg.xml and update database name and index path
	//open Persistence.java and update config refrence to point to sql server
	//make sure you remember to fix the application account.

//////Mysql 
uniqueidentifier -> varbinary(36)   (or varchar64 seems to work?)
insure that database is utf8-general 
*NOTE: if it doesnt copy all rows for all tables just delete the db and start over. It doesnt take too long (if you've cleaned hte asses out of the sql server)	
*NOTE: Image gives you grief.  An error about the maximum key something being 7xx bytes.  Just delete the unique key constraint on the image path name.  Probably just want to handle this programitically
