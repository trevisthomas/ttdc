pushy never worked.  This one worked:

notnoop
//This was the example that you followed
http://blog.kondratev.pro/2015/03/sending-ios-push-notifications-from-java.html

//This is how you downloaded the libs without maven
http://grepcode.com/snapshot/repo1.maven.org/maven2/com.notnoop.apns/apns/1.0.0.Beta6

//here's the git rep
https://github.com/notnoop/java-apns

//All you did was add the no dependencies jar and your cert from the mac and it's working.

On the device, you used the ray wenderlich tutorial

Be aware, that the apns library works with the p12 files directly, no need for the pem.  So, it's pretty easy to get a new cert setup.
